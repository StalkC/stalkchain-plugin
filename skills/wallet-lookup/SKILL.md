description: Look up any crypto wallet address. Use when the user pastes a wallet address or asks what a wallet holds, what it's worth, how much it has made or lost, how old it is, who funded it, what it has been doing, or whether it belongs to a known trader.

# Look up a wallet

Tell the user who or what this wallet is, what it holds, and what it has done. Use the StalkChain connector, and spend credits only on the chain the address belongs to.

## 1. Identify the chain

- **Solana** addresses are base58, 32–44 characters.
- **EVM** addresses (Ethereum, Base, BNB Chain, Monad, Hyperliquid, Robinhood Chain) are `0x` followed by 40 hex characters. One EVM address is the same wallet on every EVM chain.

## 2. Look it up

**Solana wallet**
1. `stalkchain_wallet_pnl` with `wallet` (500 credits, or 250 with `includeHoldings: false`): realised and unrealised profit, win rate, total invested, average buy size and current positions.
2. Only if you skipped holdings above, or the user wants the USD breakdown: `stalkchain_wallet_portfolio` with `wallet` and `chains: ["solana"]` (250 credits).

**EVM wallet**
1. `stalkchain_wallet_portfolio` with `wallet` (250 credits per five chains, so 500 for all seven): holdings and USD value on every chain. Pass `chains` when the user names specific ones, and `minValueUsd` to drop dust.
2. `stalkchain_wallet_age` with `wallet` (500 credits per chain, so pass `chains`): first transaction and lifetime activity. A brand-new wallet moving large sums is the clearest warning sign.
3. If asked what it has been doing, or who funded it: `stalkchain_wallet_transfers` with `wallet` and `chain` (500 credits), newest first. Use `order: "asc"` to see how the wallet started and who funded it.

In Claude and ChatGPT, `stalkchain_wallet_portfolio` shows the user an interactive card. Don't re-list every holding; say what stands out. Where no card appears (a terminal), list the top holdings.

**Is it a known trader?** StalkChain can't look up who owns an arbitrary address: trader search matches names and handles, not wallets. If the user thinks it belongs to a particular trader, ask for the handle, run the **trader-check** skill, and compare the wallets it returns with this address.

## 3. Answer in this shape

**Wallet:** shortened address (`0x1234…abcd`), chain, and the trader's name if known.

**Worth now:** total USD value and its top five holdings.

**Track record (Solana):** profit, win rate and number of tokens traded.

**Age and activity:** first seen, number of transactions, and any warning such as "created 2 days ago".

**Recent activity:** only if transfers were fetched. Summarise the largest moves; don't list everything.

To check how risky the holdings are, offer the **portfolio-review** skill.

## Rules

- A missing value is `null`, never zero. A chain listed under failed chains was not checked; it is not empty.
- Public blockchain data is public, but don't speculate about the real-world identity of a wallet owner beyond what the data shows.
- Keep raw JSON out of the answer. Data, not financial advice.
