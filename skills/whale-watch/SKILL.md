# Whale watch

Show the user the biggest recent moves: **large trades by tracked traders, and what named wallets have been moving.** Use the StalkChain connector. The live feed is the cheapest call there is, so start there.

## 1. Big trades by tracked traders

Call `stalkchain_fomo_alerts` (125 credits per call) with:

- `type: "buy"` or `type: "sell"` (one call each if the user wants both), or `type: "whale"` for the feed's own whale events;
- `minUsd` set to the user's threshold (default 10,000);
- `chain`, `tokenAddress` or `trader` when the user names one, and `since` for a time window.

Know what the dollar figure means. On a **buy** it is the trader's whole position after the buy, not the size of the buy. On a **sell** it is the realised profit or loss on that sale. Use `tradeUsd` when present for the trade size. For the true size of the few largest buys, call `stalkchain_fomo_trade_detail` with `tradeId` and `trader` (250 each), and ask before checking more than three.

Each call returns at most the newest 100 events, so a long window may not be fully covered; filter by type and chain to reach further back, and say what time range you covered.

Free alternative for "right now": `stalkchain_fomo_watch_stream` with `stream: "trades"`, `minUsd`, `side` and `durationSeconds` (0 credits) listens to live on-chain fills, where the dollar value is the real fill size. It covers Solana and Robinhood Chain only and may not be available on every plan; if it errors, use the feed above.

## 2. Named wallets

- **EVM wallet:** `stalkchain_wallet_transfers` with `wallet`, `chain` and `limit` (500 credits): transfers in and out, newest first, with USD values where known.
- **Solana wallet:** there is no transfer list. Use `stalkchain_wallet_pnl` with `wallet` (500) for positions and recent profit.
- **A trader's handle:** filter the feed with `trader`, or follow **trader-check**.

## 3. Answer in this shape

**Biggest moves:** a table, largest first: time, trader or wallet, buy or sell, token and chain, size, and which measure the size is (trade size, position value or realised profit).

**Pattern:** one or two sentences, e.g. "Mostly sells on Base; two tracked traders took profit on the same coin."

**Wallets:** for each named wallet, its largest moves in the period.

Then one line: *"This is data, not financial advice."*

## Rules

- Never present a position value or realised profit as a buy or sell size. Label which one it is.
- "Tracked traders" are a curated set, not every whale on chain. A missing value is `null`, never zero.
- A big buy is not a reason to buy. Don't speculate about who owns a wallet. Keep raw JSON out of the answer.
